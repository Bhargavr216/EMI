 **Q1. Research Process and Research Design**

**Definition**
Research process is a systematic sequence of steps used to identify a research problem, collect relevant data, analyze it scientifically, and derive valid conclusions. It ensures logical flow and accuracy. Research design is the overall plan that defines methods, tools, and procedures. It controls variables and reduces errors. Together they ensure reliable and valid research outcomes.

**Research Process – Stages**

* **Problem Identification**
  Selection of a clear and specific problem that defines research direction and scope.
* **Literature Review**
  Study of journals, books, and reports to understand background and research gaps.
* **Objectives and Hypothesis**
  Objectives define goals; hypothesis provides a testable assumption.
* **Data Collection and Analysis**
  Data is gathered and analyzed using suitable statistical or analytical techniques.
* **Report Writing**
  Findings and conclusions are documented in a structured manner.

**Research Design**

* Acts as a blueprint of research execution
